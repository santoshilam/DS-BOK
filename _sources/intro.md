# Introduction

Welcome to the Data Steward Use Cases compedium. This document was created to capture the experiences and knowledge the data stewards working in several Dutch university. We selected rather common situations faced by researchers during their work, making explicit the data-related challenges, as to highlight what constitute "problems" and how to address them. We hope that this document will be of use to researchers, when preparing their projects, and data stewards in-training, as to get ready to what is out there. 


## What is this book about? 

This book provides a collection of disciplinary research projects from various faculties and departments within 4TU partner organisation; Delft University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology and the University of Twente. The case study were selected on the basis of their frequency of appearance in the research projects suported by the 4TU data steward community. If a case is described in here, it happens in real life too! 

## Who is this book for? 

Data stewards, data support professionals and researchers 

- Facilitate peer-to-peer learning among data stewards through the collection of unique and unusual (non-standard!) use cases. 
- Identify similarities and differences in research data management practice across diverse research disciplines 
- Will allow data stewards to provide advice in a more comprehensive manner (rather than an over-simplified overview?) 
- Can be reused/modified in an educational context to inform students about various aspects of RDM
- Can be combined with an RDM checklist 
- Can be used to form the basis of guidance for data stewards and researchers.

## Why read this book? 
  
There are 2 main ways of reading this book: for education purposes, and for a specific case. 

If you are interested in the data management in research projects in general, feel free to start at Use Case 1 and read along. 

However, if you are interested in a specific case that you will be facing in the near future, we recommend that you use the "search feature" of the online book, or use the table of content to find which case could be the most related to your situation. The use cases described in this book should give you a fair view on what challenges you may face. For each use case, we hope to provide a complete perspective on what needs to be accounted for.
  
## How can you use this book? 
  <Note by Nico: given what I've written above, this section seems redundent... I'm not sure I can do "why" and "how" separately. Shall we merge those 2?> 
- Can we suggest how the case studies should be navigated and read? 
- Could we include an RDM checklist at the end? 
- How could the book be used in an educational setting? 
  
## How was this book created? 
  
This book was collaboratively written by the data stewards of the 4TU Community, using the Git Pages tools!
  
## How to contribute!
  
We'd love to expand our collection of use cases. If you have an interesting project you'd like to add... xxx


# Notes for authors - how to edit MD files and such!

Anything below this title is purely for editing the document and will be removed before the document is finalized.

## Naming convention for folders and files ! 

Just to avoid issues, here is how you should name your folders. BE CAREFUL about CAPITALIZATION! 

X_chapter/name-of-the-file.md 

The name of the file mattersis less relevant, but the folders must be in the order in which we want to see them in the table of content! 

Here are some useful links for the redaction process.
