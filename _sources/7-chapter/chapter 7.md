# Case study 7: Tracer update

Author: Judith Brands and Qian Zhang

## Project background

This research project is aiming at assessing diagnostic tool efficiency, based on previously collected medical information. The principal investigator 
is a staff member of the hospital, who also conducts research in partnership with a university.

For this project, the goal was to evaluate imaging quality and tracer usage to diagnose patients with cancer, as a retrospective study.

This project will generate data regarding tracer uptake in specific organs, and a qualitative assessments of the resulting scan. 
Based on this, the suitability of the tracer/scan for diagnostic purposes can be evaluated.

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection

In this project, the research team expects to re-use scans that were done on patients over time. 
All datasets have been pseudo anonymized, however, due to the medical nature of the data, re-identification is a possibility.
  - medical history (past diagnosis and treatments)
  - Patient characteristics (age/sex)
  - Imaging data

All datasets are being made available to the principal investigator by the hospital.

### Ethics 

According to the Wet medischp-wetenschappelijke onderzoek met mensen act (WMO), medical research involving humans should be assessed by an accredited METC or a CCMO in advance (before collecting data). 

Since the researcher has double affiliation (the UMC as the first affiliation and the university as the second), it is important to determine the ownership of the data in advance. This can be specified in a contract between the UMC and the university. In this instance, the data was considered to be the property of the hospital.



### Privacy 

  In this project, personal data is going to be processed, therefore, researchers should comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR; the European privacy law). At UT, anyone who processes personal data should register the personal data in a GDPR form which will be checked by the university data protection officer. Informed consent was used to ensure that the personal data was used in accordance to the data subject wishes. 


### Data storage and sharing

Personal data consulted during this project was not shared beyond the study team at the hospital. There was no specific need to share this data with other actors of the project. The data remained within the hospital network, and accessed with respect to their established security measures. 

## Solutions & advice

### Data storage

Given the sensitivity of the manipulated data, it seems reasonable to avoid useless data transfer between insitutions - in this instance, the researcher followed all instructions given to him by the hospital. 

Because medical information falls under the special category of personal data, all accesses are restricted. 

Given that the host hospital is quite versed in handling this type of information, guidelines issued by the hospital should be followed. 

Derived datasets which may include some personal data must be destroyed, and all published datasets must be pseudo-anonymized before being shared. 

### Legal 

All activities related to medical data must be framed by contracts. In this case, the principal investigator is an employee of the hospital, and therefore bound by the rules and regulations of the institute. 

## Advice (process)

In this instance, given the sensitivity of the data, it is recommened to follow all process, university and hospital, to the letter. 
The DMP must be very precise as to what data will be used, and where it is stored. 

In addition to Ethics oversight, additional input from the privacy/legal team, regarding the safeguarding of the data may be required. In such cases, a Data Protection Impact Assessment may be requested.
It is important for actors of this project to have a known protocol to follow in case of data loss or data leak.
